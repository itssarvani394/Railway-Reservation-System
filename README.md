The provided C++ project is a railway reservation system designed to manage train schedules, passenger bookings, and ticket reservations. It consists of classes representing passengers, trains, days, and the main reservation system. Passengers can be added with details such as name, age, and gender, while trains are defined with attributes like number, name, and total seats. The system allows users to interact through a menu-driven interface, where they can view available trains for a specific day, display passenger details for a particular train, book tickets for passengers, and cancel existing reservations. With functionality to handle reservations and cancellations, the system offers a straightforward solution for managing railway bookings efficiently.
